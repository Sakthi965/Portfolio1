        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I am  a third-year Bachelor of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student at the Government College of Engineering, Salem. Currently, I am enhancing my technical skills through the Protosem course, while simultaneously nurturing my broader interests and aspirations. My ultimate goal is to become a civil servant, a role in which I can make meaningful contributions to society .Creativity plays a vital role in my life. I have a deep passion for Tamil poetry writing, which has not only enriched my creative expression but also sharpened my attention to detail. I take pride in my meticulous approach to language, ensuring precision in punctuation .

                In addition to my technical and creative pursuits, I am keenly interested in exploring socialism as an academic discipline. This interest reflects my desire to understand diverse socio-political ideologies and engage in informed discourse about the future of our society . I believe in maintaining a positive outlook, exuding confidence, and treating everyone with respect. My journey is driven by a commitment to continuous learning and excellence, and I welcome opportunities to collaborate and grow both personally and professionally.</p>
